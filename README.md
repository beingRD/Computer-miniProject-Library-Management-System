# Computer-miniProject Library Management System
Library Management System miniProject in C++ is a simple console application built without the use of graphics. 
This project Library Management System help in managing Library Management System for school/college , which would provide all library functions.

Rational: To improve library uses services and reduce paperwork.

Scope of Project:

- To make the existing system more efficient.
- To provide a user friendly enviroment where user can be serviced better.
- Make functioning of library faster.
- Provide a system where the library staff can catch defaulters and not let them escape.
- To minimize the loss done to books.
